This is an "open source" release of the IDevity IDOne source code.  Most of the source code headers make the following reference:

"The following code belongs to IDevity and is provided though commercial license or by acceptance of an NDA only."

This will be addressed over time, and a suitable open source license will be applied to the code where applicable.

If this code is used as the basis of a new application, or it is merely re-skinned, we ask that you provide attribution for the example and source we are providing.
